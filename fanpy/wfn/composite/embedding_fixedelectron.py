        Since the overlap can be drivatized with respect to the parameters of the underlying

        Parameters
        ----------
        sd : int

        deriv : {2-tuple, None}

            First element of the tuple is the wavefunction. Second element of the tuple is the
            indices of the parameters of the corresponding wavefunction. The overlap will be
            derivatized with respect to the selected parameters of this wavefunction.
            Default returns the overlap without derivatization.

        Returns
        -------
        overlap : {float, np.ndarray}
            Overlap (or derivative of the overlap) of the wavefunction with the given Slater
            determinant.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If given Slater determinant is not an integer.
            If `deriv` is not a 2-tuple where the first element is a BaseWavefunction instance and

        ValueError
