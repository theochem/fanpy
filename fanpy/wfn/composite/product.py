    Attributes
    ----------
    wfns : tuple of BaseWavefunction
        Wavefunctions whose overlaps will be multiplied together.

    Properties
    ----------
    nparams : int
        Number of parameters.
    nspatial : int
        Number of spatial orbitals
    spin : int
        Spin of the wavefunction.
    seniority : int
        Seniority of the wavefunction.
    dtype
        Data type of the wavefunction.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(self, nelec, nspin, wfns, memory=None, params=None)
        Initialize the wavefunction.
    assign_nelec(self, nelec)
        Assign the number of electrons.
    assign_nspin(self, nspin)
        Assign the number of spin orbitals.
    assign_memory(self, memory=None):
        Assign memory available for the wavefunction.
    assign_params(self, params=None, add_noise=False)
        Assign parameters of the wavefunction.
    enable_cache(self)
        Load the functions whose values will be cached.
    clear_cache(self)
        Clear the cache.
    assign_wfns(self, wfns)
        Assign the wavefunctions whose overlaps will be multiplied together.
    get_overlap(self, sd, deriv=None) : {float, np.ndarray}
        Return the overlap (or derivative of the overlap) of the wavefunction with a Slater
        determinant.

    Notes
    -----
    In the case where one set of wavefunctions is already optimized and another set is added in
    hopes to improve the overall wavfunction, this second set must be initialized such that it
    produces an overlap of 1 for every Slater determinant. Otherwise, the work done optimizing the
    first set of wavefunction is lost.
