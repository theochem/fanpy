class GeneralizedCC(BaseCC):
    r"""Generalized Coupled Cluster Wavefunction.

    We will consider CC wavefunctions in their product form.

    .. math::

        \[\left| {{\Psi }_{generalized-CC}} \right\rangle =
        \prod\limits_{u,v}{\left( 1+t_{u}^{v}\hat{\tau }_{u}^{v}
        \right)}\left| {{\Phi }_{ref}} \right\rangle\]

    where the excitation operators:

    .. math::

        \[\hat{\tau }_{u}^{v}=
        a_{{{v}_{1}}}^{\dagger }...a_{{{v}_{n}}}^{\dagger }{{a}_{{{u}_{n}}}}...{{a}_{{{u}_{1}}}}\]

    act on a give reference wavefunction (i.e. :math:`\[\left| {{\Phi }_{ref}} \right\rangle \]`)

    No occupied/virtual separation is assumed.
    Within a given excitation operator, annihilators appear in increasing order, from right to
    left (correspondingly, creators appear in decreasing order, from right to left). The
    excitation operators are ordered in increasing level of rank (e.g. the semi-sum of the
    number of creation and annihilation operators in a given string of such operators), from right
    to left. Operators with the same rank are ordered following the lexicographical ordering of
    cartesian products.

        Parameters
        ----------
        indices : None
            Only the default (i.e. using all possible indices) is allowed.

        -----
        The excitation operators are given as a list of lists of ints.
        Each sub-list corresponds to an excitation operator.

        spin-orbitals to annihilate, and the second half corresponds to the indices of the
        spin-orbitals to create.
