    def assign_exops(self, indices=None):
        """Assign the excitation operators that will be used to construct the CC operator.

        Parameters
        ----------
        indices : {list of list of ints, None}
            List of indices of the two disjoint sets of virtual orbitals to which one will excite
            the occupied orbitals.
            The default uses alpha/beta separation.

        Raises
        ------
        TypeError
            If `indices` is not a list of list of ints.
            If `indices` is not None.
        ValueError
            If one tries to excite to occupied spin-orbitals.
            If the lists of creation operators are not disjoint.

        Notes
        -----
        The excitation operators are given as a list of lists of ints.
        Each sub-list corresponds to an excitation operator.
        In each sub-list, the first half of indices corresponds to the indices of the
        spin-orbitals to annihilate, and the second half corresponds to the indices of the
        spin-orbitals to create.
        In previous assign_exops methods if one provides a non-default option for indices the first
        sublist corresponds to indices of annihilation operators and the second sublist to indices
        of creation operators, and we do not check if there are common elements between these
        sublists. In this case both sublists correspond to indices of creation operators,
        and they must be disjoint. It is assumed that one will excite from occupied alpha
        spin-orbitals to indices given in the first sublist, and from occupied beta
        spin-orbitals to indices given in the second sublist.
        Takes care of any repetition in the sublists, and sorts them before generating the
        excitation operators.
