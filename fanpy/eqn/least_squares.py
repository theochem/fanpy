    where :math:`M` is the number of Slater determinant onto which the wavefunction is
    projected.

    The energy can be a fixed constant, a variable parameter, or computed from the given
    wavefunction and Hamiltonian according to the following equation:

    .. math::

        E = \frac{\left< \Phi_\mathrm{ref} \middle| \hat{H} \middle| \Psi \right>}
                    {\left< \Phi_\mathrm{ref} \middle| \Psi \right>}

    where :math:`\Phi_{\mathrm{ref}}` is a linear combination of Slater determinants,
    :math:`\sum_{\mathbf{m} \in S} c_{\mathbf{m}} \left| \mathbf{m} \right>` or
    the wavefunction truncated to a given set of Slater determinants,
    :math:`\sum_{\mathbf{m} \in S} \left< \mathbf{m} \middle| \Psi \right> \left|\mathbf{m}\right>`.

    Additionally, the normalization constraint is added with respect to the reference state.

    .. math::

        f_{\mathrm{constraint}} = \left< \Phi_\mathrm{ref} \middle| \Psi \right> - 1

    Attributes
    ----------
    wfn : BaseWavefunction
        Wavefunction that defines the state of the system.
    ham : BaseHamiltonian
        Hamiltonian that defines the system under study.
    indices_component_params : ComponentParameterIndices
        Indices of the component parameters that are active in the objective.
    step_print : bool
        Option to print relevant information when the objective is evaluated.
    step_save : bool
        Option to save parameters when the objective is evaluated.
    tmpfile : str
        Name of the file that will store the parameters used by the objective method.
        If a file name is provided, then parameters are stored upon execution of the objective
        method.
    pspace : {tuple/list of int, tuple/list of CIWavefunction, None}
        States onto which the Schrodinger equation is projected.
        By default, the largest space is used.
    refwfn : {tuple/list of int, CIWavefunction}
        State with respect to which the energy and the norm are computed.
        If a list/tuple of Slater determinants are given, then the reference state is the given
        wavefunction truncated by the provided Slater determinants.
        Default is ground state HF.
    eqn_weights : np.ndarray
        Weights of each equation.
        By default, all equations are given weight of 1 except for the normalization constraint,
        which is weighed by the number of equations.
    energy : ParamContainer
        Energy used in the Schrodinger equation.
        Used to store/cache the energy.
    energy_type : {'fixed', 'variable', 'compute'}
        Type of the energy used in the Schrodinger equation.
        If 'fixed', the energy of the Schrodinger equation is fixed at the given value.
        If 'variable', the energy of the Schrodinger equation is optimized as a parameter.
        If 'compute', the energy of the Schrodinger equation is computed on-the-fly with respect to
        the reference.
