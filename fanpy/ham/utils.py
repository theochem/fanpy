        Function that returns the integral
        :math:`\left< \mathbf{m}_1 \middle| \hat{H} \middle| \mathbf{m}_2 \right>` from the given
        Slater determinants and the basis set representation of the Hamiltonian.
        `sd1` and `sd2` are integers whose bitstring describes the occupation of the Slater
        determinant. See `fanpy.tools.slater` for more details.
        `integrals` is a numpy array that contains the parameters of the wavefunction.
    integrals
        Basis set representation of the Hamiltonian.
    orders : tuple of integers
        Tuple of integers of the orders of excitations involved in the Hamiltonian.
        Does nothing if `integrate_sd_wfn` is provided.
        Default is the one- and two-body operators.
    integrate_sd_wfn(self, sd, wfn, wfn_deriv=None) : function
        Method for integrating Slater determinant with a wavefunction.
        `sd` is the Slater determinant.
        `wfn` is the wavefunction instance.
        `wfn_deriv` is a numpy array of integer indices of the wavefunction parameters with respect
        to which the integral is derivatized.
