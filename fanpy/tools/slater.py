r"""Collection of functions used to construct and manipulate Slater determinants.

Slater determinants are represented with bitstrings that describe their occupation. The `0` would
correspond to an unoccupied orbital and the `1` would correspond to the occupied orbital. To ensure
that the lower order excitations are smaller in value, the orbital indices are counted from the
right to the left. For example, `0b00110011` will have the occupied orbitals with indices 0, 1, 4,
and 5.

It will be **assumed** that the creators within a Slater determinant are ordered from smallest to
largest from left to right. i.e. :math:`\ket{1, 3, 5} = a^\dagger_1 a^\dagger_3 a^\dagger_5 \ket{}`

For most of the time, the orbitals are spin orbitals, and their spin is designated by splitting the
orbitals into two blocks. If there are :math:`K` spatial orbitals, then the first block of :math:`K`
spin orbitals are the alpha orbitals, and the second block of :math:`K` spin orbitals are the beta
orbitals. The spin orbitals can be equivalently described with alternating alpha and beta spin
orbitals, but in the current module, the Slater determinant will be assumed to be organized in the
"block" format.

Though Python integers (in the binary format) can be used as a representation of the occupation
vector, the `int` object is used by default.

All references/changes to a Slater determinant should be made using this module, such that if we
decide to change the format of the Slater determinant, only this module needs to be changed.
