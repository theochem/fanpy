    Paramaters
    ----------
    sd : int
        Slater determinant.
    nspatial : int
        Number of spatial orbitals.
    spin : int
        Spin of the desired Slater determinant.
        :math:`\frac{1}{2} (N_{\alpha} - N_{\beta})`.
        If `None` then all spin is allowed.
    seniority : int
        Seniority of the desired Slater determinant.
        Maximum number of unpaired electrons.
        If `None` then all seniority is allowed.

    Returns
    -------
    condition : bool
        True if Slater determinant has the desired spin and seniority.
        False if Slater determinant does not have the desired spin and seniority.

    r"""Return a list of Slater determinants.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nelec : int
        Number of electrons.
    nspin : int
        Number of spin orbitals.
    num_limit : {int, None}
        Maximum number of Slater determinants to be generated.
        Default is infinite.
    exc_orders : {list of int, None}
        Orders of excitations that is to be included (with respect to ground state Slater
        determinant) in the order that they appear.
        Default is all orders of excitations (in the order of lowest order to highest).
    spin : {int, float, None}
        Total spin of the generated Slater determinants.
        Default is no spin restrictions.
        If positive, then the number of alpha orbitals is greater than the number of beta orbitals.
        If negative, then the number of alpha orbitals is less than the number of beta orbitals.
        0.5 is singlet, 1 is doublet, 1.5 is triplet, etc.
    seniority : {int, None}
        Maximum number of unpaired electrons.
        Default is no seniority restritions.

    Returns
    -------
    sds : list of ints
        Integer that describes the occupation of a Slater determinant as a bitstring.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If nspin is not an integer.
        If nelec is not an integer.
        If num_limit is not an integer.
        If exc_orders is not a iterable of integers.
        If spin is not an integer or float.
        If seniority is not an integer.
    ValueError
        If num_limit is not greater than 0.
        If seniority is not compatible with the spin.
