    .. math::

        \left<\Phi \middle| \Psi\right> - 1 = 0

    where :math:`\Phi` is some reference wavefunction.

    Attributes
    ----------
    wfn : BaseWavefunction
        Wavefunction that defines the state of the system.
    indices_component_params : ComponentParameterIndices
        Indices of the component parameters that are active in the objective.
    refwfn : {tuple of int, CIWavefunction}
        Wavefunction against which the Schrodinger equation is integrated.
        Tuple of Slater determinants will be interpreted as a projection space, and the reference
        wavefunction will be the given wavefunction truncated to the given projection space.

    Properties
    ----------
    indices_objective_params : dict
        Indices of the (active) objective parameters that corresponds to each component.
    all_params : np.ndarray
        All of the parameters associated with the objective.
    active_params : np.ndarray
        Parameters that are selected for optimization.
    active_nparams : int
        Number of active parameters in the objective.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(self, wfn, ham, param_selection=None, tmpfile="")
        Initialize the objective.
    assign_params(self, params)
        Assign the parameters to the wavefunction and/or Hamiltonian.
    wrapped_get_overlap(self, sd, deriv=False)
        Wrap `get_overlap` to be derivatized with respect to the (active) parameters of the
        objective.

    def __init__(self, wfn, refwfn=None, param_selection=None):
        r"""Initialize the norm constraint.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wfn : BaseWavefunction
            Wavefunction that defines the state of the system (number of electrons and excited
            state).
        refwfn : {tuple/list of int, CIWavefunction, None}
            Wavefunction against which the norm is integrated.
            Tuple of Slater determinants will be interpreted as a projection space, and the
            reference wavefunction will be the given wavefunction truncated to the given projection
            space.
            By default, the given wavefunction is used as the reference by using a complete
            projection space.
        param_selection : tuple/list of 2-tuple/list
            Selection of the parameters that will be used in the objective.
            First element of each entry is a component of the objective: a wavefunction,
            Hamiltonian, or `ParamContainer` instance.
            Second element of each entry is a numpy index array (boolean or indices) that will
            select the parameters from each component that will be used in the objective.
            Default selects the wavefunction parameters.
