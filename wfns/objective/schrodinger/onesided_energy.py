            Selection of the parameters that will be used in the objective.
            First element of each entry is a component of the objective: a wavefunction,
            Hamiltonian, or `ParamContainer` instance.
            Second element of each entry is a numpy index array (boolean or indices) that will
            select the parameters from each component that will be used in the objective.

            Wavefunction against which the Schrodinger equation is integrated.
